abstract: "This paper analyzes the living-cost data from low-income families living in Toronto, which is hosted publicly by the Open Data Toronto. It uses information on household income, expenses, government fiscal transfers and benefits to determine if low-income families are able to survive financially in Toronto. It was discovered that expenses exceeded income for most families (meaning low-income families are not able to survive in Toronto), and rent, food costs were among the highest expenses. This finding is important as it shows cost disprity in expenses, and guide fiscal policymakers on how they can help low-income families with living costs."
